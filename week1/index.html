      Most often Philippinos immigrate to work aboroad for several years with the intention of finally returning Philippines. These temporary migrants are not coming to the US.  Instead, they work in the Middle East in countries like Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar or in Asian countries such as Japan.

      <div class="story-body">
          <p class="body-text">The thing is that moving aborad from Philippines is often done based of contracts between companies and embassies. These are most often made in rich countries with heavy constrctuion schedule. Qatar with 2022 Worl Cup is a great example. In US there are less contracts. </p>
          <p class="body-text">The other thing is that Philippino government really encourages people to leave. So since there are so many people leaving every year 200 000 people (that many came to US in 2018) reprsesent only 10 % of Philippinos overseas. And even 50 000 Philippinos get permanent residence from the US every year, that is only a tiny fracture of all the Philippines aboroad.</p>
