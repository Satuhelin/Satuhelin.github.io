      <p class="body-text serif">What unites Finland, a country in North Europe and Minnesota, a state in the US? They were both places where lot of refugees from Somalia were settled after bloody civil war in Somalia in 1990s. Minnesota just got famous for voting the fist person with Somali background to Congress. In Filnad that has not yet happende.</p>

      <h3 class="section-head serif">More than half are employed</h3>
      <p class="body-text serif">In both Minnesota and Finland, more than half of the Somali minority in work force are employed. </p>
      <p class="body-text serif">The biggest difference is in the status of "unempolyed". Based on Cencus and Finnish Statistics Authoiry data it seeems that the reason is simple; in Finland it is faster and easier to get umemployment benefit. On the other hand, in Finald, there is less space between employed and unempolyed, thereofre, almost everyone who do not have official working contract are counted as unempolyed. </p>

        <p class="body-text serif">To go little deeper on the professions that are most common among people who have Somali as their mother tongue in Finland it is possible to see that there has not been lot of changes among top professions in last years. The biggest proportional growth is in expert level professions and in transportation.  </p>
